# DMD-Stock-Market-Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a novel approach for stock market prediction using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).
The objective is to create a model that can accurately predict stock prices and compare its performance with traditional and modern prediction techniques. 
The ultimate goal is to publish the results in an IEEE journal.
